## Lite vs. full Peebify

Peebify Launcher Lite is the open-source, standalone edition of [Peebify](https://peebify.net/). It is the same launcher core, minus everything that depends on a Peebify account or server.

| | Lite | Full Peebify |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Install, update, repair and mod games | ✅ | ✅ |
| Optional account with syncing (playtime, settings, mods) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Launcher updates itself | ❌ | ✅ |
| Wallpapers | ✅ | ✅ |

The only things it fetches from Peebify's servers are the launcher's endpoint config (`launcher/api.json`) and the wallpapers. It does not update itself, to get newer versions of Peebify Launcher Lite you must grab from the latest releases of this repository or rebuild it yourself.

## Building from source

Lite is distributed as source. You will need:

- Windows 10/11 with the [WebView2 runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable) with the MSVC build tools

```bash
npm install
npm --prefix webui install

npm run dev     # run the launcher in development
npm run build   # production build, packaged as a setup installer
```

`npm run build` writes the setup installer to `dist/installer/Peebify-Launcher-Lite-Setup-<version>.exe`. The bare launcher executable is at `target/release/peebify-launcher.exe`.

### Project layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src-tauri/` | The launcher backend (Rust, Tauri 2) |
| `webui/` | The launcher interface (React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind) |
| `helpers/` | Helper processes: FPS unlocker, mod loader, overlay hotkeys |
| `installer/` | The Windows setup program |
| `scripts/` | The build script that packages the launcher into the setup installer |
